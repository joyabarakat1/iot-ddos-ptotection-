# IoT DDoS Protection System

A lightweight neural network-based solution for detecting and preventing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This project processes network traffic data, builds machine learning models for attack detection, and deploys these models via a containerized API.

*Developed by Kevin Kfoury*

## Project Overview

IoT devices are increasingly targeted by DDoS attacks due to their limited security capabilities and widespread deployment. This project uses a combination of real-world data from the UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset and synthetic data for training and testing. The project aims to:

1. Process and clean raw network traffic data
2. Extract meaningful features for DDoS attack detection
3. Train a lightweight neural network suitable for resource-constrained environments
4. Optimize the model for low-power deployments (TensorFlow Lite)
5. Deploy the model via a containerized API for integration into existing security infrastructure
6. Provide a user-friendly dashboard for visualization and monitoring

## Data Source

This project uses two primary data sources:

1. **UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset**: Contains real-world network traffic data from IoT devices under normal operation and various DDoS attack scenarios, https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset .

2. **Synthetic Data**: Generated to supplement the real-world data, providing additional attack patterns and scenarios not covered in the original dataset. This synthetic data helps improve model generalization and robustness.

The model was trained and evaluated on both real and synthetic data to ensure its effectiveness across a wide range of attack scenarios.

## Technical Approach

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Raw Data Cleaning**: Processes CSV files from the UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset containing network traffic, adds appropriate headers, and removes empty columns
2. **Neural Network Preprocessing**: Extracts and transforms features relevant for DDoS detection, including:
   - Protocol information
   - Network ports
   - Packet sequence numbers
   - Statistical features (mean, stddev, min, max)
   - IP address components
   - Traffic rate metrics

### Model Architecture

The neural network uses a lightweight architecture designed for IoT environments:

### Training Process

The neural network was trained using a combined dataset of:
- Real network traffic from the UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Dataset
- Synthetic traffic patterns generated to cover additional attack scenarios

This hybrid approach ensures that the model can detect both known attack patterns from the original dataset and novel attacks represented in the synthetic data. The training process used:

- 80% of the real data for training
- 70% of the synthetic data for training
- Remaining portions of both datasets for validation and testing

This split allowed for comprehensive evaluation on both the original data distribution and synthetic attack scenarios.

### Model Versions

Two model versions were developed to meet project requirements:

1. **Standard Model (Baseline)**: `ddos_model_final_20250412_205328.h5`
   - Full precision TensorFlow model (~15KB)
   - Used as the baseline for performance comparison
   - Suitable for server-side deployment where resources are less constrained

2. **Optimized Model**: `ddos_model_final_int8_20250412_205328.tflite`
   - Int8 quantized TensorFlow Lite model (~4KB)
   - Optimized specifically for resource-constrained IoT environments
   - 73% smaller than the standard model while maintaining comparable accuracy
   - Significantly reduced inference time and memory requirements

The performance comparison shows that the optimized model maintains accuracy while dramatically reducing the resource footprint, making it ideal for edge deployment on IoT gateways or other constrained environments.

## API Usage

The model is deployed as a REST API for easy integration:

```python
import requests
import json

# Example network traffic data
traffic_data = {
    "proto": "tcp",
    "saddr": "192.168.1.1",
    "sport": 80,
    "daddr": "192.168.1.2",
    "dport": 443,
    "seq": 12345,
    "stddev": 0.05,
    "min": 0.01,
    "mean": 0.5,
    "max": 1.0,
    "state": "CON",
    "drate": 0.002
}

# Send prediction request
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5000/predict", 
                        json=traffic_data, 
                        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})

# Process response
result = response.json()
print(f"Prediction: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.4f}")
```

## Frontend Dashboard

The project includes a Streamlit-based web dashboard (`frontend.py`) that provides a user-friendly interface for:

1. Visualizing network traffic and DDoS detection results in real-time
